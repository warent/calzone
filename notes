Define another Docker container that behaves as a "proxy" layer with ports that get forwarded
Every time a new Calzone is installed, recreate the proxy machine with newly forwarded ports

Proxy machine is on the same bridge network as Calzone
Some kind of load balancer with all ports forwarded to the proxies to avoid downtime?
